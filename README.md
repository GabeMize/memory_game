# Memory Game

This is a website to play the children's memory game.  Player selects a card to flip over then chooses another card to flip over.  If both
cards match they stay flipped over.  Once eight matches are created the game is over.  A star rating is used to rate the game.  Best
games are completed in five stars.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and open index.html in web browers:
```
$git clone https://github.com/GabeMize/memory_game.git
```

## Usage

Game is best viewed on the newest version of _Chrome_ but should work on any modern web browser or mobile device.

#### Bugs and TODO

*Some users have experienced the setTimeout function not working but the lastest upload should fix that.  (Error with background-color of card)

*The logic for determining the star rating should be improved, switch statement implemented.
